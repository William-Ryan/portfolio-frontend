                <h2>Who is William Ryan?</h2>
                <p>I'm first and foremost a lover of technology and learning who's ambition and determination 
                    allows them to tackle any problem head on and find the solution! My technical profession is 
                    being a Full-Stack Developer, but truthfully I feel my education and experiences have given 
                    me so much more then the average Developer. I am confident with time I can take just about 
                    any language or library and gain an aptitude for it's knowledge. I look forward to getting to 
                    know you better and perhaps even working together. Thank you!</p>

                    This list is open and likely in this very moment is being expanded and explored so feel
